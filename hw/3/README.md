1. Name the three pillars of Science.   
**Experiment, Theory, Computational**  
2. Name and briefly describe three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences.  
**Predictive computing:data anaylsis to figure out what happens next       
Numerical simulation:computer caulations in a program    
Data-driven discovery via machine:a combination of historical data and computation to find trends**     
3. Name the two types of scientific reasoning.  
**Plausible(Inductive) and Deductive**  
4. Provide an example that shows logical implication does not necessarily imply physical causation.  
**It's raining, therefore it's cloudy.**   
5. Policeman, jewelry, and burglar.  
**If the burglar alarm rings and a gentleman in a mask walks out with a bag full of jewlery, then the policeman doesn't hesitate in deciding the gentleman is dishonest.**  
6. Logical Implication.

7. Logical product denial.

8. Logic functions with 1 input.

9. Logic functions with 2 inputs.

10. Logic functions in terms of logic functions.

11. The fundamental logical operators.

12. Consider the following series of questions:  
a. What is the tiniest unit of information?       
Hint: This unit also represents the tiniest bit of information in computers.   
**A Bit**    
b. Why does this amount of information represent the tiniest information unit?        
Hint: Use inductive logic with examples to explain your reasoning.
**The bit is the tinest unit of information, it only holds 0's and 1's.**   
Imagine yourself as a single dot in empty space in a universe devoid of anything else.  
Would you be able to tell your coordinates in the universe? **No**   
or whether you are moving? **No** or at what constant speed? **No**   
Why? What extra piece of information do you need to answer the above questions?   
**The ability to find the coordinates in the universe would have to be comparable to another location but the universe is an empty space devoid of anything else. To answer the above question, another object or person would have to present to draw a comparison. Same with speed and movement.**     
c. Letâ€™s assign a box to this tiniest representable amount of information.  
Obviously, we cannot represent much information with it. So, our remedy is to put multiple of these boxes to represent information about something.  
1. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 1 such boxes? **2**   
2. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 2 such boxes? **4**
3. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 3 such boxes? **8**  
Hint: Draw binary trees as we described in class to justify your answers
