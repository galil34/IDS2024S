14. What are the three common types of errors in computer programs? Provide an example for each category.  
**Syntax: spelling and punctuation errors**  
**Runtime: error while program is running after being compiled**  
**Semantic: grammatically correct text that does not make sense**  

15. Suppose you write a program that has memory leak. What type of programming error are you dealing with?  
**A resource leak when a program does not release unneeded memory**   

16. Consider the following chessboard.  
Suppose I ask you to put a single rice grain in the first square.  
Then I ask you to put incrementally one more grain in each new square than the previous one.  
How many grains would you need to put in the last (64th) square?  
**64**

**0.297**   

17. Consider the following chessboard.   
Suppose I ask you to put a single rice grain in the first square.  
Then I ask you to put incrementally one more grain in each new square than the previous one:  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …  
How many grains would you need to put in the last (64th) square?  
**64**  
How many grains overall would you need to fill all chessboard squares incrementally as described above?
