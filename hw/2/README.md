14. What is fastest part of the memory in the memory hierarchy of modern computers?  
**Register memory**   

15. What is typically the smallest memory unit in the memory hierarchy of modern computers?  
**Bit or memory tape or microseconds or milliseconds**  

16. How much faster is the access to the register memory compared to RAM in modern computers?  
**seconds

17. How much faster is the access to the RAM compared to typical SSD hard drives in modern computers?  
**seconds

18. How much faster is the access to the RAM compared to typical HDD hard drives in modern computers?  
**seconds

19. What are the primary roles of transistors in computers?  
**They are switches that let current through and act as an on or off button**

20. We know that more transistors mean faster computers.  
Then, why cannot we add more transistors to computers to make them faster?  
**

21. What are the three tasks accomplished within a CPU cycle?  
**Fetch, decode, execute**  

22. Can a powerful computer with more CPU cycles be slower than a computer with less CPU cycles? Why or How?  
**Yes because they became so small it started to affect the movement of electrons in parts of the circuit and caused unnecessary heating and bit flipping**

23. What is the bottleneck of speed in modern computers? CPU clocks or memory access? Why?  
**Memory access because the development of smaller transistors made CPUs increasingly faster than the typical memory access speed of the time**

24. What is the difference between the Dennard Scaling, MOSFET scaling, and Moore’s law?  
**Dennard Scaling uses smaller transistors, Moore's law uses more transistors, MOSFET scaling reduces the parameters according to the transistors** 

25. Consider the following chessboard.    
Suppose I ask you to put a single rice grain in the first square.  
Then I ask you to put incrementally one more grain in each new square than the previous one.  
How many grains would you need to put in the last (64th) square?  
**64**  
How many grains overall would you need to fill all chessboard squares incrementally as I asked above?  
**2080**  
A pound of rice is roughly 7000 grains. How many pounds of rice would you need for this task.  
**0.297**   

26. Consider the following chessboard.  
Suppose I ask you to put a single rice grain in the first square.  
Then I ask you to put in each subsequent square twice more than the previous square grains:  
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, …  
How many grains would you need to put in the last (64th) square?  
**9,223,372,036,854,775,808**

**Exponential curve: a line only when x-axis is plotted on log scale  
Power-law curve: a line only when the x-axis and y-axis are plotted on log scale**
