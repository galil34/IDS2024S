1. What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
**Data visualization maps data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic**  
**A few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization include color, shape, and size**  
2. Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
**Continuous & Discrete**  
3. Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
**Quantitative: numerical values  
Qualitative: categorical values**   
5. What is the common name for variables holding qualitative data?  
**Categorical/Factors**  
6. Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
**Ordered:

9. What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?  

10. Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations.   

11. Which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data?  

12. What kind of data set can be best visualized in polar coordinates?  
**Data of a periodic nature**   
13. Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage. **Qualitative color scale: distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order    
Sequential color scale: indicates which values are larger or smaller than which other ones and how distant two specific values are from each other.   
Diverging color scale: indicates the deviation of values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.     
Accent color scale: effective to higlight specific elements in the data.**
