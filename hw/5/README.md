1. What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
- **Data visualization maps data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic**  
- **A few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization include color, shape, and size**  
2. Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
- **Continuous & Discrete**  
3. Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
- **Quantitative: numerical values**   
- **Qualitative: categorical values**   
4. What is the common name for variables holding qualitative data?  
- **Categorical/Factors**  
5. Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
- **Ordered: good, fair, poor**   
- **Unordered: dog, cat, fish**  
6. What are the types of data in the columns of the following table?  
- **Month: qualitative/categorical/discrete/ordered**  
- **Day: qualitative/categorical/discrete/ordered**  
- **Location: qualitative/categorical/discrete/unordered**  
- **Station ID: qualitative/categorical/continuous/unordered**  
- **Temperature: quantitative/numerical/continuous/unordered**  
7. What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?  
- **x and y axis in a coordinate system**  
8. Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations.   
- **Log-transformation can be used to plot data containing numbers at different magnitudes.**  
9. Which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data?  
- **e2 & e1**  
10. What kind of data set can be best visualized in polar coordinates?  
- **Data of a periodic nature**   
11. Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.
- **Qualitative color scale: distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order**     
- **Sequential color scale: indicates which values are larger or smaller than which other ones and how distant two specific values are from each other.**     
- **Diverging color scale: indicates the deviation of values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.**       
- **Accent color scale: effective to higlight specific elements in the data.**       
12. What is wrong with the following visualization?  
- **The visualization generated negative ages in the distribution.** 
13. Best visualization coloring.  
- **Purple-green because 5%-8% of men are colorblind.**

- **Honolulu is hotter**   
- **Honolulu has less fluctuating temperatures**   
- **Duluth: y=0.0001x+39.949 R2=0.0002**    
- **Honolulu: y=7E-05x+77.049 R2=0.0031**  
15. Visualizing the average precipitation of the US states vs. sunshine.

16. Better visualizations through axes transformation.  
- **The approximate population of the 1000th most populous city in Texas is illegible**
- **Based on the axis-transformed plot, the approximate population of the 1000th most populous city in Texas is 1,000**
- 
17. The proof of Bayes' Rule via Venn diagram.  

18. The major schools of thought in Probability Theory.  
- **Classical, Bayesian, Frequentist, Propensity**  
19. Extra Credit: Puzzle: What living creatures do you see?  
- **I see 2 living creatures, a frog and a horse.**  
20. Extra Credit: Puzzle: Matchstick Wrong Equation.  
- **Remove the match from the number 8 to make it a number 9, then move it to number 0 to make it a number 8.**
