1. What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
- **Data visualization maps data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic**  
- **A few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization include color, shape, and size**  
2. Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
- **Continuous & Discrete**  
3. Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
- **Quantitative: numerical values**   
- **Qualitative: categorical values**   
4. What is the common name for variables holding qualitative data?  
- **Categorical/Factors**  
5. Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
- **Ordered:**   
- **Unordered:**  
6. What are the types of data in the columns of the following table?  
- **Month:**  
- **Day:**  
- **Location:**  
- **Station ID:**  
- **Temperature:**  
7. What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?  
- **x and y axis in a coordinate system**  
8. Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations.   

9. Which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data?  

10. What kind of data set can be best visualized in polar coordinates?  
- **Data of a periodic nature**   
11. Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.
- **Qualitative color scale: distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order**     
- **Sequential color scale: indicates which values are larger or smaller than which other ones and how distant two specific values are from each other.**     
- **Diverging color scale: indicates the deviation of values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.**       
- **Accent color scale: effective to higlight specific elements in the data.**       
12. What is wrong with the following visualization?  

13. Best visualization coloring.  
- **Purple-green because 5%-8% of men are colorblind.**
14. Visualizing and comparing the temperatures of Honolulu and Duluth via Excel.  

15. Visualizing the average precipitation of the US states vs. sunshine.  

16. Better visualizations through axes transformation.  

17. The proof of Bayes' Rule via Venn diagram.  

18. The major schools of thought in Probability Theory.  
- **Classical, Bayesian, Frequentist, Propensity**  
19. Extra Credit: Puzzle: What living creatures do you see?  
- **I see 2 living creatures, a frog and a horse.**  
20. Extra Credit: Puzzle: Matchstick Wrong Equation.  
- **Remove the match from the number 8 to make it a number 9, then move it to number 0 to make it a number 8.**
