2. The three historical types of Version Control Systems are the local VCS, centralized VCS, and distributed VCS.
3. The best historical type of version control system is the distributed VCS because every user in the project has a clone of the central repository with a full backup in case of failure, the project can be restored. 
4. Describe the commands:   
a. git pull: Pulls the latest project revisions from the remote to the local repository.     
b. git status: Checks the status of the project.     
c. git add --all: Stages the modified and deleted files without the newly-created files.    
d. git commit -m"latest build": Commit the staged files to the local repository with a message without opening a new page.  
e. git push --all: Pushes commits from local repository to remote repository, to place permanently and to be able to share them with others.
