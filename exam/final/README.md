1. What is the difference between model validation and calibration?  
- **  
2. what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
- **Data visualization maps data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic, a few aesthetics that can appeat in a data visualization include color, shape, and size.**  
3. Best visualization coloring.  
- **Purple-green**  
4. Visualization color scales.  
What is each color-scale good for in Data Science?  
- **A) qualitative: distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order.**  
- **B) sequential: indicate which values are larger or smaller than which other ones and how distant two specific values are from each other.**   
- **C) diverging: indicated the deviation of values in one of the two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.**  
- **D) accent: effective to highlight specific elements in the data.**  
5. Name the three pillars of science.  

6. Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with a real-world example.  

7. Suppose we have fit the following red-line to the following blue dataset representing the global temperature increase of Earth over the past centuries.  
- Is this visually a good fit in your opinion? Why?  

- What type of uncertainty dominates this dataset in the early years (before 1850)?  

- Is the trend seen in this dataset an example of positive correlation or negative correlation?  

- Could this dataset be classified as timeseries data? Why?  

- Download this dataset visualized above.  
Then, open the file in Excel and compute the average temperature anomaly over all dates available in the file and report the single average value here.  

8. Which school(s) of probability theory allow incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge in scientific inference?  

9. When data is scarce, which school of probability theory is the most useful for scientific inference?  

10. Which school of thought in Probability Theory cannot define or discuss the probability of existence of God? Why?  

11. A wrong visualization.   
- **The visualization generated negative ages in the distribution.**  
12. Why is everything represented by integers in computers?   

13. Name an ancestor programming language of C.  

14. Name the first high-level programming language in computer history.  

15. Recall the Boolean algebra’s fundamental identities from our lecture notes. Show that,   

16. Show via a Venn Diagram or a Truth Table, or explain by a logical argument that,  
How does A look relative to B? Does the same also hold for B⎯⎯⎯⎯ relative to A⎯⎯⎯⎯?  

17. Name the two different categories of logical reasoning and provide and example of each class.  
  
18. What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?  

19. Show, via Venn diagrams, that  

20. Can we represent all real numbers in computers?  
- **No**  
21. Consider the following summation:
S=3+6+9+…+93+96+99 .
What is the value of S? Explain your novel strategy to get your answer.
(Hint: There are 33 numbers in the summation.)
