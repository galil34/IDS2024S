1. Name the four major definitions of Probability (corresponding to the four major schools of thought in probability theory).  
**Frequentist, Bayesian, Classical, Propensity**   
2. Which school(s) of probability theory define(s) probability as degree of confidence?  
**Frequentist**  
3. Which school(s) of probability theory allow incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge in scientific inference?   
**Bayes Rule**    
4. When data is scarce, which school of probability theory is the most useful for scientific inference?  
**Degree of belief/Classical probability/Bayesian**    
5. Name a prominent figure (person) in each of the Frequentist and Bayesian schools of thought.  
**Ronald Fisher, Edwin Jaynes**       
6. What is the range of a probability value? Is this range a convention or a necessity of the definition of probability?  
**[0,1] or [0,+infinity] this is a range of convention**   
7. Recall our class discussion on Probability Theory. Suppose you ask two equally-trustworthy people to look out the window and tell you what they see in the distance. They both observe an animal in the distance but their observation is different. One sees a horse and the other sees donkey. Which one of the observations would you trust? Why? Which principle of Probability Theory applies to this experiment and how?   
**I would trust the observations of the person with better eyesight because it is hard to look into the distance out of a window, the principle of common sense fits the best because they can see better and make a more accurate observation.**     
8. NAND Equivalence  

9. Logic NAND and NOR

11. Show via a Venn Diagram or a Truth Table, or explain by a logical argument that (A⇒B) ≡ (B⎯⎯⎯⎯⇒A⎯⎯⎯⎯).
