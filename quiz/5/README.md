1. What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
- **Visualizations that map values into quantifiable features**  
- **Color, shape, and size are a few aesthetics**  
2. Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
- **Continuous and Discrete**  
3. What is the difference between factors and levels?  
- **
4. Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
- **Quantitative: numerical values, real numbers**  
- **Qualitative: categorical values, months**  
5. What is the common name for variables holding data?  
- **  
6. Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
- **Ordered: rankings like good, fair, poor**  
- **Unordered: descriptions like dog, cat, fish**  
7. What kind of data set can be best visualized in polar coordinates?  
- **Data of a periodic nature**  
8. Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.  
- **Qualitative color scale: distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order.**  
- **Sequential color scale: indicated which values are larger or smaller than which other ones and how distant two specific values are from each other.**  
- **Diverging color scale: indicates the deviation of values in one of the two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.**  
- **Accent color scale: effective to highlight specific elements in the data.**  
9. Professional Data Scientists tend to avoid 3D plots in their visualizations. Why?  
- **   
10. Recall our class discussions on the kinds of data, for example, numerical vs. categorical.
Describe an example dataset that could be classified as either numerical or categorical, depending on how it is represented.  
- **
11. Is color a categorical/unordered or quantitative/ordered aesthetics?  

12. Which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data?   
- **e2 & e1**   
13. Best visualization coloring.   
- **Purple-green**

(Hint. Create a column of salary data in an Excel file. Go to the Insert tab in the Excel file and look for )

This graph displays the global land temperature anomaly of earth over the past 300 years. The vertical axis basically tells use how hot Earth has been in a given year compared to the average temperature during 1951-1980? Just by looking a this graph, do you think if the temperature of Earth will increase or decrease in the following decades? Approximately, how much hotter or cooler do you think Earth will be in 2050 with respect to the average temperature during 1951-1980 (the zero anomaly temperature)? Express your answer in units of Celsius.
