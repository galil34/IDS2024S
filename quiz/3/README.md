1. Name and describe briefly the steps involved in scientific inference.  
**Reality: natural phenomena     
Data: inverse problem model construction    
Scenario: forward problem calibration and validation**     
2. Name the three pillars of science.  
**Experiment, Theory, Computation**   
3. Describe three different major applications of the third pillar of science with respect to the first two.
(Hint: Recall the discussions we had early in the semester during the first lecture series. Where and how could the third pillar replace the other pillars?)
**predictive,**
4. Name the two different categories of logical reasoning and provide and example of each class.   
**Deductive: If it is cloudy, then it is raining   
Plausible: The sun sets at 8 pm, the sky will be dark**   
5. Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with an example.   
**They are not the same, if 'A then B' expresses B as a logical consequence of A but not the reason. If it rains, then there are clouds.**     
6. Who is the Boolean algebra named after?     
**George Boole**    
7. Illustrate the logical conjunction via a Venn Diagram.   

8. Illustrate the logical disjunction via a Venn Diagram.  

9. What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?     
**They will have the same truth value**    
10. Display the logical implication A⇒B via a Venn diagram.  
(Hint. Think about the meaning of logical implication A⇒B: If A is true, then B must be true. If A is false, then B can be either true or false. What configuration of A and B circles in a Venn diagram would correspond to the above statement for logical implication? Recall that when you are inside an object (circle) in a Venn diagram, it means the proposition corresponding to that object is true. When you are outside, the proposition is false.)

11. Recall the Boolean algebra’s fundamental identities from our lecture notes. Show that,

12. Show, via Venn diagrams, that

13. Show, via Venn diagram or truth table, that    

14. NAND equivalence.  

15. Logic NAND and NOR.  

16. Logical implication in terms of logic functions.  

17. Show via a Venn Diagram or a Truth Table, or explain by a logical argument that. Hint. This is a very simple question. Recall what logical implication means in terms of a Venn diagram. How does A look relative to B? Does the same also hold for B⎯⎯⎯⎯ relative to A⎯⎯⎯⎯?   

18. Extra Credit. Was this a fair quiz (overall, as you expected)? Briefly justify your response, especially if your answer is NO. How about the past quizzes in this course? (Hint. Provide your sincere opinion. Your answer won’t impact anything about your status in this course other than giving you an extra credit in this quiz. But it will impact the design of the future quizzes.)  
**The quiz was fair, however, this very difficult and I did not enjoy it. This had much to do with venn diagrams that I did not thouroughly understand. The hardest parts were the NAND Equivalence, maybe I wasn't paying attention in class because I dont remember being taught this for more than 30 minutes, and even then, it was a student. The past quizzes in the course were enjoyable and fairly easy.**
